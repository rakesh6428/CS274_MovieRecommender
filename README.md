# CS274_MovieRecommender
We are in control of our decision when we make a choice. Unfortunately, we have to choose between infinite number of choices due to lack of personal experience and competence to choose and make decision. However, recommender system understands our preference and help us in decision making. They solely depend on our personal data, in general, the user data. The problem will arise in case of new user or product entering into the system. This situation is called as Cold start. This prototype tries to resolve the cold start issue by using demographic information of the users to provide recommendations. The K-means clustering algorithm has been used for training the model. The Movielens 100K dataset has been used to train the prototype and conduct series of experiment. This solution distinguishes itself from other previous work in the aspect of its accuracy. The result establishes effectiveness of using the demographic attributes of user to address the cold start issue.
